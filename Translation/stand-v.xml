        NP1 STAND (ADV[orientation])

        Includes: STAND UP
        Note: This sense necessarily entails the UPRIGHT position of NP1. Like sense 2
        location is also implied, but the focus is on the upright orientation of the
        NP1. If the word does not entail this orientation, then go with sense 2.

        NP1 STAND PP[location or quantifier]
        Note: This sense does not entail UPRIGHT orientation of NP1. If such is entailed
        then go with sense 1. The sense can be metaphorical.
        HINT: For many of these examples, you can replace 'stand' with 'be'
              (or with 'put' for the causative) without a big change in meaning.
              Such a substitution with examples in sense 1 would be strange.
            EX: ??? We had to be for the entire performance. (sense 1)
                The bookshelf was in the corner. (sense 2)
                ??? Put the tamales in a large steamer (sounds okay, but loses some meaning)
                Put the bookshelf in the corner.
