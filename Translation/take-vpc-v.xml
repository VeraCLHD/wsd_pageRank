      Note: If it is not one of the following multi-word expressions, please
      mark the instance as None of the Above.
      Note: ONLY choose this sense for the phrases listed below. Please
      check carefully. Extra modifiers may be added, but be sure the basic sense is the same.  For
      example, "take a big chance" would count as an instance of "take a chance."  However, "take
      a leave (from her job)" is not the same as "take leave (of his grandmother)" and should not be
      tagged with this sense.
